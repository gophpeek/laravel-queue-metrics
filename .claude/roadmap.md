- ✅ ProcessMetrics integration (accurate worker resources)

### Technical Choices
- ✅ PHPStan level 9 (maximum type safety)
- ✅ Readonly classes (immutability)
- ✅ Action pattern for business logic (testability)
- ✅ Repository pattern (abstraction)

### Deferred Decisions
- ⏸️ GraphQL vs REST (defer to FASE 7)
- ⏸️ Frontend framework choice (separate package)
- ⏸️ ML library selection (defer to FASE 9)
- ⏸️ Multi-tenancy strategy (defer to FASE 9)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Test Coverage**: 0% currently, critical for production use
  - Mitigation: FASE 2 priority, allocate time
- **Performance**: Unknown under high load
  - Mitigation: FASE 4 benchmarking

### Medium Risk
- **Breaking Changes**: Architecture stable but API may evolve
  - Mitigation: Semantic versioning, clear changelog
- **Data Migration**: Autopilot → Queue Metrics
  - Mitigation: Migration guide, tools

### Low Risk
- **Dependencies**: Well-maintained packages
  - Mitigation: Regular updates, vendor lock-in avoided
- **Community Adoption**: Niche use case
  - Mitigation: Quality over quantity, documentation
