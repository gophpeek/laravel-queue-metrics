**Status**: Production-ready architecture, needs testing and documentation

---

## FASE 2: Testing & Quality Assurance

### Priority: HIGH
**Goal**: Achieve 80%+ test coverage and eliminate technical debt

#### 2.1 Unit Tests
**Current: 90 tests passing, 175 assertions**

- [✅] Storage drivers - RedisStorageDriver (23 tests)
- [✅] Config classes validation (15 tests)
- [✅] Actions - Job recording (19 tests: RecordJobStartAction, RecordJobCompletionAction, RecordJobFailureAction)
- [✅] Actions - Worker state (8 tests: TransitionWorkerStateAction)
- [⏸️] Database storage driver (needs integration tests)
- [⏸️] Trend analysis calculations (needs integration tests due to final classes)
- [⏸️] Server metrics health scoring (needs integration tests)
- [ ] Worker heartbeat logic
- [ ] Statistical functions (linear regression, R²)

#### 2.2 Integration Tests
- [ ] Database storage driver with MySQL/PostgreSQL
- [ ] Redis storage operations
- [ ] Trend data collection workflow
- [ ] Worker state transitions
- [ ] Queue depth monitoring

#### 2.3 Feature Tests
- [ ] All API endpoints
- [ ] Prometheus export format
- [ ] Console commands
- [ ] Event listeners
- [ ] Health check logic

#### 2.4 PHPStan Cleanup
- [⏸️] Current: 38 baseline errors (down from 114: **76 errors fixed - 67% reduction** 🎉🎊)
- [✅] Removed unused properties in RecordTrendDataCommand (2 errors fixed)
- [✅] Fixed ProcessSnapshot property access in RecordWorkerHeartbeatAction (2 errors fixed)
- [✅] Added type guards to 11 DTO fromArray methods - First pass (20 errors fixed)
  - Simple DTOs: DurationStats, BaselineData, FailureInfo, HealthStats, JobExecutionData, MemoryStats, ThroughputStats, WindowStats, WorkerStatsData (8 errors)
  - Composite DTOs: JobMetricsData, QueueMetricsData (12 errors)
- [✅] Fixed array_merge in CalculateJobMetricsAction (3 errors fixed)
- [✅] Eliminated double-access pattern in all DTO fromArray methods (16 errors fixed)
  - Extract array values before type checking to avoid casting mixed twice
  - All 11 DTOs now have clean fromArray implementations
  - Zero DTO errors remaining in PHPStan baseline
- [✅] Fixed double-access pattern in QueueMetricsConfig (1 pattern, 4 instances fixed)
- [✅] Improved type safety in repository arithmetic operations (2 errors fixed)
  - RedisQueueMetricsRepository::calculateHealthScore() - validate all metrics before math
  - All 4 Repository cleanup() methods - validate timestamps before age calculation
  - Pattern: Extract → validate with is_numeric() → cast → perform arithmetic
- [✅] Fixed PrometheusController PHPDoc syntax and dead code (11 errors fixed)
  - Invalid PHPDoc array shape syntax: quoted string keys for numeric-looking keys
  - Removed 5 unnecessary null coalescing operators on guaranteed array keys
  - Resolved offsetAccess.nonOffsetAccessible errors (6 errors)
  - Eliminated nullCoalesce.offset dead code (5 errors)
- [✅] Fixed ServerMetricsController type safety (5 errors fixed)
  - Added proper PHPDoc type annotations for server metrics arrays
  - Refactored health() method with early return pattern
- [✅] Removed dead code in job event listeners (3 errors fixed)
  - JobFailedListener, JobProcessedListener, JobProcessingListener
  - Laravel's Job interface guarantees getJobId() and getQueue() are non-null
- [✅] Fixed ServerMetricsService PHPDoc syntax (8 errors fixed - cascading!)
  - Single PHPDoc fix resolved 8 cascading offsetAccess errors
- [✅] Fixed QueueMetrics facade type annotations (2 errors fixed)
  - Added detailed array shape types to @method PHPDoc annotations
- [✅] Fixed array key type in RedisJobMetricsRepository (1 error fixed)
  - Cast float values to strings when using as Redis zadd array keys
  - PHP array keys must be int or string, not float
- [⏸️] SystemMetrics external library errors (5 class.notFound, 2 property.notFound - won't fix)
- [⏸️] StorageManager undefined method (5 errors - false positive, interface mismatch)
- [⏸️] Binary operation errors (5 remaining - complex type narrowing, low priority)
- [⏸️] Laravel compatibility checks (2 method_exists - intentional for backward compatibility)
- [⏸️] LaravelQueueInspector mixed types (~10 errors - complex Redis interactions)
- [⏸️] Prometheus facade parameter counts (3 errors - facade false positive)
- [⏸️] Other edge cases (8 errors - various low-impact issues)
- [✅] **PRIMARY MILESTONE: <50 baseline errors achieved! (114 → 49 = 57% reduction)**
- [✅] **STRETCH GOAL: <40 baseline errors exceeded! (114 → 41 = 64% reduction)** 🎊

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None
